# Instagram-fake-spammer-genuine-accounts-or-Instagram-fake-Account-Detection
This project aim is to implement a deep learning model capable of detecting and flagging fake or spam Instagram profiles for improved social media integrity.

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake accounts on Instagram using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify fake accounts, reducing the risk of spam, phishing, and other malicious activities on the platform.

## Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess Instagram account data.
- Develop a machine learning model to detect fake accounts.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
- Provide insights into the characteristics of fake accounts.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Data storage: CSV files

## Features
- Account feature extraction: Extracts relevant features from Instagram account data, such as follower count, post count, and engagement rate.
- Model training: Trains a machine learning model to detect fake accounts based on the extracted features.
- Model evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Insights & Outcomes
- Identified key features that distinguish fake accounts from genuine accounts.
- Developed a model that can accurately detect fake accounts on Instagram.
- Provided insights into the characteristics of fake accounts, helping to improve platform security.

## Future Work
- Integrate the model with Instagram's API to enable real-time fake account detection.
- Continuously update the model to adapt to evolving fake account patterns.
- Explore the use of deep learning techniques to improve model performance.
